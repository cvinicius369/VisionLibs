# VISION LIBS

**Vision Libs** is a lightweight library designed to simplify the creation of graphical windows on both Windows and Linux systems.  
It removes the need for large external frameworks or deep knowledge of low-level system programming.

The library is divided into two parts (two separate folders or libraries):

- **VisionForWindows** – focused on the Windows operating system, using the Win32 API to support window creation.
- **VisionForLinux** – focused on Linux systems, using the X11 library for window management and rendering.

With Vision Libs, developers can create basic windows, buttons, text, and graphical elements with minimal setup and maximum portability.
